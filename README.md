# cashflow_model

Python cash flow model with classes and foreign exchange simulations. 

## Classes

In order to model the cash flow, the classes were created in [model.py](model.py), which includes a Credit class, a Loan class, a Bank class and a Model class. 

## Test

In the [Jupyter Notebook](CrowdLoan.ipynb), we show how the classes can be used to project the cash flow of a company and analyse the risk with random exchange rate simulations. The historic rates where downloaded using the ForeignExchange API.

## Test results

The test results were stored in csv files, which can be opened in Excel.
